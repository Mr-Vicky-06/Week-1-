# AICTE EDUNET Internship (Garbage Classification)

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based garbage classification system using transfer learning techniques. Leveraging the power of EfficientNetV2B2, a highly efficient and accurate pre-trained convolutional neural network, the model classifies images of waste into distinct categories. The dataset is augmented and preprocessed to improve generalization, while class imbalance is addressed using computed class weights. The architecture is enhanced with dropout and dense layers to reduce overfitting and boost classification accuracy. To ensure optimal training, techniques such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling are implemented. The model is evaluated through a detailed confusion matrix and classification report, ensuring robust performance across all classes. This solution not only demonstrates the practical use of AI in environmental management but also serves as a foundation for real-time waste segregation applications using tools like Gradio for interactive deployment.
